    <h1>Air-Fried Italian Stuffed Tomatoes</h1>
    <p>
        Garlic, Parmesan cheese, fresh basil, and toasted nuts turn brown rice into 
        a superstar stuffing in this Italian-inspired stuffed tomato side dish that's 
        cooked in the air fryer.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium tomatoes</li>
        <li>Olive oil, as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup cocked brown rice</li>
        <li>1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup italian-seasoned breed crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut tops off tomatoes and scoop out flesh with a melon baller, 
            leaving 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick sides and bottoms. Discard tomato 
            tops and flesh. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Brush the bottom of an air fryer basket with olive oil. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine cooked rice, Parmesan cheese, goat cheese, walnuts, 
            1 tablespoon basil, and garlic in a medium bowl. Combine bread 
            crumbs, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small bowl. Fill tomatoes 
            with rice mixture, then sprinkle with bread crumb mixture. Place 
            stuffed tomatoes into the prepared air fryer basket. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook in the air fryer at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) until tomatoes 
            are tender, filling is heated through, and topping is golden brown, 
            about 15 minutes. Garnish with remaining basil. 
        </li>
    </ol>
